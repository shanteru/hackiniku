# fine-tuning-GPT2

This repo contains the code for the Medium Article: [Fine-tuning GPT2 for Text Generation UsingÂ Pytorch](https://towardsdatascience.com/fine-tuning-gpt2-for-text-generation-using-pytorch-2ee61a4f1ba7).

The `run_language_modeling.py` and `run_generation.py` are originally from Huggingface with tiny modifications.
