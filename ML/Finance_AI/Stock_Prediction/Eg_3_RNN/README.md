# Stock-Prediction-with-RNN-in-Pytorch
Basic Stock Prediction using a RNN in Pytorch.
I coded a basic RNN to predict Stocks. In particular, I used an LSTM and a time window of 20 steps. I downloaded the database 
from kaggle(https://www.kaggle.com/dgawlik/nyse). 
I chose to predict Apple and I used Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Facebook in order to help with the prediction.
