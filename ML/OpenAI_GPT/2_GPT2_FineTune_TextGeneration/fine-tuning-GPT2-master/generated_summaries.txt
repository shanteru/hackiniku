<BOS>  The novel begins with the discovery of the "First Generation" (the book's eponymous narrator) at the age of twelve: the descendants of the founding members of the Earth Liberation Front. They are an alien race with an Earth population of less than 500,000, as well as an advanced technology such as telepathy, telekinesis, and telekinesis-in-a-sketch. It is unclear whether or not the First Generation are in fact descendants of humanity; they have the ability to teleport and the ability to see into space at will. This leaves a "second generation" (the narrator) to decide where to take the Earth. They are then led to the home planet of Gila. The first generation is led to Earth, but they encounter some problems, and find that they are not as far from home as they could have hoped, or had expected, to find out. As the Earth Liberation Front is losing its independence, the second generation is forced to make the decision between either surrendering and joining the First Generation; surrendering with humanity, surrendering with a Second Generation, and abandoning the First Generation. While a lot of these choices are made on the fly, there are some notable exceptions, such as when the First Generation decides to sacrifice themselves by "waking up" and finding a way to survive on the Earth.

<BOS>  The book deals with the rise of the "great" class, the ruling class of the country's twentieth century. It tells the story of a society of "goods" in which everything, from art and technology to money and prestige is seen as an asset, as though it were somehow tied to the environment, the laws of nature, and the law of nature itself. The book begins with the rise of the great class from humble beginnings, until, after the fall of the Ming Dynasty, the "great" class's prosperity was dramatically impaired. The "great" class gained a reputation for excellence in all fields of endeavor. They were not respected for their achievements; they were considered "bad" or "dirty", and their behavior led to ridicule and degradation in society. For example, among the ladies of a school, there was gossip that one girl's father "looked like the devil" and her mother "looked like the devil". The Great class quickly suffered as their superior status became a source of pride. Their society was not respected and they were often persecuted by the rulers. The Great class saw that everything in their society was seen by others as a good thing, not something to be trusted, so they would often resort to force to enforce their own political and economic aims. To improve their social position, the Great class allowed themselves to be trained for the military and the military courts. In addition, the Great class also provided the education of the children of their servants. They als
